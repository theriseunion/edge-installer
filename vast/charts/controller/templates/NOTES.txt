VAST Controller (Operator) has been deployed successfully!

The Controller is a standard Kubernetes Operator that:
  - Defines and manages CRDs for heterogeneous computing resources
  - Reconciles compute resource states
  - Manages compute cards from multiple vendors (GPU, NPU, Tianshu, Hygon, Moore Threads, Suiyuan, Cambricon, Kunlunxin, etc.)

To check the Controller status:
  kubectl get deployment {{ include "controller.fullname" . }}-manager -n {{ include "controller.namespace" . }}

To view the logs:
  kubectl logs deployment/{{ include "controller.fullname" . }}-manager -n {{ include "controller.namespace" . }}

To check CRDs:
  kubectl get crds | grep device.theriseunion.io

CRDs and related resources will be created and managed automatically by the controller.
