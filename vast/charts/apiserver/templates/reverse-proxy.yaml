# If the Secret doesn't exist yet (e.g., during initial deployment), insecureSkipVerify is used as a fallback.
# After the certificate is ready, simply run `helm upgrade` to automatically populate caBundle.
# This resource is created as a normal Helm resource (not a hook) to ensure it's always created reliably.
